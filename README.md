# SNL Giphy

## Description
This web page uses the Giphy API to generate gifs to the page based on what button was selected

## Instructions
In order to use this application, create your own API key here [Giphy](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/sdk/).
Click a button on the top of the web page to generate 10 gifs of the SNL cast member selected.
The user can create their own button by entering text in the search field and clicking "Add your own cast member!".
The button will be generated at the top of the web page and can be clicked to generate gifs based on the user input.

## Contribution
This project can be improved with the following;
* Adding persistence so the gifs and user created buttons stay on the web page after closing the window.
* Adding functionality so the search button generates different gif results from the first ones that were generated.
